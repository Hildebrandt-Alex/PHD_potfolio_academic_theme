### R blogdown package:
   
With R blodown you can create websites using R Markdown documetns and static HUGO templates.
[__This__](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) book is a good starting point to get a feeling for the folder structure of a R blogdown project and the configuration of the important files. One chapter is about deployment with *Netlify* and *GitHub*. So there is all information you need to generate a online available website.

This site is also build with the R blogdown package. I used the Academic Theme. [__Here__](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) you will find the Documentation.

### Academic theme 

The Academic theme includes a website builder which is called *Wowchemy* and is open source. This website builder has several preconfigured widgets that you can use to decorate and personalize your site.
