## Create an admin user for the backend


When starting a django project an admin backend is created automatically. To hace access to this backend first a superuser has to be created. Before this can be done you have to migrate databases with the following command (virtual environement activated):

    pyhton3 manag3.py makemigrations
    pyhton3 manag3.py migrate
    
This ensures that all tables are available in the backend. Next you need to create a superuser with:

    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    
After typing name and password of the backend admin you can launch it.
